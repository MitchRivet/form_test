# form_test 

thanks for reading my code! 

NOTES: 
1. I opted to use as few libraries as possible. in a normal context, I might opt to use create-react-app, bulma (css framework), and react-select for a case like this (among others) 
2. Given more time, I certainly would've added more tests, a button to delete hobbies from the list, and validation logic (this could be a part of the reducer or native html validation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation. I likely would use a combo of both to also protect against sql/javascript injection through the form)  
3. My next step would also be to convert the form component to a higher order component
